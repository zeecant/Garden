# Garden
A game concept made for the Game Makers Toolkit Game Jam that I wasn't quite happy with.
The theme of the Jam was Duality (controls doing more than one thing, mechanics serving multiple purposes, etc.)

The idea of the game was to grow a garden while insects are trying to eat the plants you are growing.

I think the concept was there, but I wasn't able to flesh it out enough to be a good game, or something I was happy to submit as "finished".

Arrow keys to move, Space to water plants/move seeds.
